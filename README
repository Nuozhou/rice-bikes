Rice Bikes Processing App
=========================

This site is built for use by the employees of Rice Bikes, the student-
run bike shop at Rice University.

Users can enter the information of a customer, including email address. 
When the order is submitted, the customer will receive an email from
the bike shop confirming they have been processed. When the job is
finished, the emloyees can update the status to completed, and the 
customer will receive an email notifying them that they can come in
and pick up their bike.
