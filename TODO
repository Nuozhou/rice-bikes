1. Fix url routing error where .com/1/1/3/ will route to detail page for pk=3.

Reason: The routing doesn't currently check for stuff in front of the url

2. Figure out how to do a cancel button in a form.

Question: How to get the pk for a generic view class

3. Integrate Bootstrap 3 to make site mobile-friendly and not like it is from ca. 1985.

Question: How to integrate (crispy-whatever?)

4. Set up email sending.
